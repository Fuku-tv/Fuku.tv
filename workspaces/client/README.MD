Hello Jason, welcome to the react branch of fuku.tv! ðŸ˜Š

## summary

I have added a /src folder which contains all of the react-specific logic for your app.

## Commands (any cli)

### install NPM packages and build dist folder

```bash
yarn
```

yarn start
```

Let me know if you have any questions!
