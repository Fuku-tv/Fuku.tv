## commands

simply push changes to the 'main' branch and seed.run will automatically deploy the app to our S3 bucket with cloudfront

## file descriptors (root)

- .gitignore - ignores generated files from git tracking
- lintstagedrc.mjs - lint-staged command list per file (triggered by pre-commit hook)
- .prettierrc - config file for format on save extension
- package.json - list of node dependencies
- sst.json - seed.run config file to deploy stack
- tsconfig.json - config file for typescript language
- yarn.lock - tells Seed.run to use yarn to install node packages before deploying app to S3 (DO NOT TOUCH)

## folder descriptors

- .husky - container for git hooks (just runs lint-staged on staged files before git commit)
- .parcel-cache - parcel cache generated by dev server (code generated - DO NOT TOUCH)
- .vscode - contains settings.json for vscode, prevents "CRLF" line endings when making a new file
- build - parcel build output, pushed to S3 on deploy
- dist - parcel dev output
- node_modules - npm package install directory (do i have to explain?)
- src - React source code
  - components - custom reusable react components
  - routes - app pages
  - services - typescript functions and third-party API logic
  - stare - (maybe) state management for react
